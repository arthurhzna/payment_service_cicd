Make VM Compute Engine Google Cloud

-> 35.222.34.xxx (user->arthurhozana123)
-> allow tcp:3000 

prepare ssh, your can use powershell or puttygen

your vm :
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
---> GatewayPorts yes
sudo systemctl restart sshd

your pc: 
ssh -N -R 0.0.0.0:3000:127.0.0.1:8003 arthurhozana123@35.222.34.xxx

now midtrans can hit endpoint webhooks

but it doesnt work because Midtrans only accepts HTTPS APIs.
you can use Ngrok as a simple solution.
